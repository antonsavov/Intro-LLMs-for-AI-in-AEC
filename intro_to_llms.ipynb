    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an introduction of using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly OpenAI’s models, for various tasks. It covers topics such as embeddings, text generation, as well as more advanced concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), function calling, and agent-based tools. The tutorial also demonstrates how to interact with visual data, handle text summarization, and manage conversation history in chatbots. The overall goal is to equip users with the initial skills to effectively leverage LLMs in their workflows, particularly in architecture and related fields.\n",

    "\n",
    "Great Mosque of Djenné — Djenné, Mali: Built in the 13th century, the Great Mosque is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a prime example of Sudanese architecture. Its adobe construction, featuring three towering minarets and a large central courtyard, represents a blend of Islamic and pre-Islamic architectural traditions. It doesn't get more visually striking and culturally significant than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seagram Building — New York City: The Seagram Building is both beloved and controversial and a paragon of modernist architecture and the International Style. Its sleek glass and bronze exterior, combined with an innovative use of space, set a standard for skyscraper design, embodying Mies van der Rohe's famous dictum “less is more.” It sits across from Gordon Bunshaft's equally innovative (and arguably more beautiful) glass curtain wall building, the Lever House. If you want to understand midcentury modern architecture, just spend some time ogling at the corner of 53rd and Park Avenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Portland Building — Portland, Oregon: Just because a building is iconic doesn't mean it's any good. Bergdoll points to the Portland Building by Michael Graves, one of the West Coast's most identifiable (and derided) landmarks, to prove his point. “Even if you like postmodernism, you know it's a bad building,” he says. What's his beef with this quirky monolith that helped define an architectural movement, you ask? Well, there's the issue of the oppressive working spaces within. “It feels like 3,000 feet between your desk and the nearest window.” Then there's the 1982 building's shape and facade, which Bergdoll describes as a boring box with a slightly better wrapping than you'd get for a gift at Macy's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salk Institute — La Jolla, California: This 1965 building, one of architect Louis Kahn's many bona fide masterpieces, is renowned for its timeless elegance and integration with its natural surroundings. The symmetrical layout and use of materials such as concrete and teak contribute to a sense of harmony, reflecting Kahn's emphasis on connecting monumental man-made form with nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casa Milà — Barcelona: Why is a short-lived aesthetics-first design period like Art Nouveau dismissed as frivolous in architecture circles? Sinuous lines and floral patterns perennially just don't get enough love from the black turtleneck crowd. Nonetheless, France had its master in Hector Guimard, Belgium had Victor Horta, and in Spain there was Antoni Gaudí, who was responsible for popular tourist destinations like Sagrada Familia and Park Güell. Between its undulating stone facade and a lack of straight lines, Gaudí Casa Milà, completed in 1912, is one destination for design enthusiasts and culture buffs alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "432 Park Avenue — New York City: Another controversial entry, the late Rafael Viñoly's 1,397-foot-tall skyscraper, completed in 2015, is representative of a movement we'll look back on in 50 years and wonder how we survived it. The my-building-is-taller-than-yours era gave us numerous needle towers, but one reigns supreme in the psyche of New York residents and tourists alike. “I think of all of those buildings, it's the most recognizable,” Bergdoll says. “And you can see it from I-95 in Connecticut.” 432 Park Avenue has redefined the world's most famous skyline, so it's an obvious choice for this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notre-Dame du Haut — Ronchamp, France\n",
    "a white building with a triangular roof with notre dame du haut in the backgroundValueyou/Creative Commons\n",
    "Swiss architect Le Corbusier, like some other architects with buildings on this list, designed more than one icon. Though, in his canon of work, one building truly holds a place atop the rest. His 1954 Notre-Dame of Ronchamp is a masterpiece celebrated for its sculptural and expressive form—a swooping roof, asymmetric walls and scattered window placement. In the 1950s, when buildings like Seagram were going up, emphasis was universally placed on function and rectilinearity by architects. How's that for contrast?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guggenheim Museum — Bilbao, Spain: Yes, Frank Gehry's museum is a landmark example of deconstructivist architecture, with its freeform curvilinearity and titanium cladding that, at the time, challenged design conventions. But its impact on Bilbao has been more powerful beyond what anyone could have predicted. A single building essentially revitalized the Basque city and made it a top European tourist destination. “It completely changed the landscape,” Bergdoll says. “It's so iconic that when you're in Bilbao, you feel like you're in the wrong place if you can't see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Louvre Museum — Paris: A museum's architecture can be just as iconic as the artwork it houses inside, and the Louvre Museum in Paris is proof. Fun fact: The museum's incredibly iconic glass pyramid was built by I.M. Pei, the first non-French architect to work on the project. Controversy certainly ensued.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sydney Opera House — Sydney: The Sydney Opera House had to overcome a series of hurdles before cementing itself as the most popular performance hall. Though Danish designer Jørn Utzon's won over 233 other submissions in 1957, the project faced a series of complications and Utzon formally resigned in 1966. However, Utzon agreed to rejoin the project in 1999, adding the final touches before the Sydney Opera House reopened in 2004.\n",
    "\n",
    "Petronas Twin Towers — Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: As the world's tallest twin towers since 1996, the Petronas Twin Towers were designed with a Malaysian spirit in mind. From a bird's-eye view, each tower resembles an eight-point star, an Islamic symbol for unity, harmony, stability, and rationality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colosseum — Rome: The Coliseum or Coliseum from Palatine Hill Also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, an oval amphitheater in the center of the city of Rome, ItalyEducation Images//Getty Images\n",
    "While Rome's Colosseum was originally built in A.D. 70 to serve as a fighting arena, it has since become an architectural landmark not to be missed. With a round facade and ancient Roman details, this is one iconic building that has withstood the test of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shard — London: Though it's relatively new to the London skyline, the Shard has already become an iconic fixture. Determined to create a “vertical city,” architect Renzo Piano drew inspiration from the nearby strand of railroads, sail ship masts, and paintings from Canaletto. The result? A building that is both modern and majestic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flatiron Building — New York City: Built by Chicago-based architect Daniel Burnham in 1902, this iconic building is planted in the middle of New York City. The building—and the neighborhood 285 feet below—got its name from its unique, wedge-shape form.\n",
    "\n",
    "World Financial Center — Shanghai: As Shanghai's World Financial Center proves, good things come to those who wait. Construction on the Kohn Pedersen Fox-designed building began in 1997 but wasn't finished for another decade. Not only was it dubbed one of the tallest buildings in the world upon completion, but its three observation decks also offer impressive views of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Palace of Versailles — Versailles, France: Since construction began in 1631, the Palace of Versailles has transformed from the primary residence of Louis XIV to a museum of the history of France. However, this French institution hasn't lost an ounce of opulence. From its famous hall of mirrors to the 100,000 gold leaves that flank its gate, the palace still feels downright royal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taj Mahal — Agra, India: A UNESCO World Heritage site—and one of the new seven wonders of the world—India's Taj Mahal is a bona fide marbled masterpiece. There's a reason people travel from near and far to see this symmetrical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Palace of Westminster — London: Speaking of the Shard, the tower's observation deck has a clear sight of another beautiful, British building: the Palace of Westminster. While most of the original structure burned down in the Great Fire of 1934, Sir Charles Barry spearheaded the renovation, complete with a Gothic facade and, of course, the famous Big Ben clocktower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notre Dame — Paris: Not only does the Notre Dame Cathedral draw in approximately 13 million visitors per year, but its Gothic facade and stoic interior make it one of the most popular churches in the world. Though part of the structure tragically burned down in 2019, the Notre Dame still lives on in architecture infamy.\n",
    "\n",
    "St. Basil's Cathedral — Moscow: Located in Moscow's Red Square, St. Basil's Cathedral gives the tourist destination a storybook flair. Fun fact: The bold colors that currently adorn the cathedral weren't added until more than 200 years after completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empire State Building — New York City: From the Freedom Tower downtown to 432 Park Avenue near the Upper West Side, New York's small island is packed with iconic skyscrapers. But perhaps nothing epitomizes New York quite like the Empire State Building. Completed in 1931, this iconic building symbolize the city's ambition, innovation, and a competitive spirit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eiffel Tower — Paris: Of course, no conversation about Paris architecture is complete without praising the Eiffel Tower. Erected for the World's Fair of 1889, the Eiffel Tower was selected out of 107 projects and has since become synonymous with Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "Burj Khalifa — Dubai, United Arab Emirates: Clocking in at over 2,700 feet, Dubai's Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest building in the world. But despite its extravagance, this record-breaking building has a soft side. In fact, architect Adrian Smith drew inspiration from the UAE's beloved flower, the spider lily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum — New York City: With its modern, bulbous silhouette, Frank Lloyd Wright might not be the first name that comes to mind when you see the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. However, the father of Prairie style is responsible for this iconic New York structure. Wright was commissioned to design the Guggenheim museum in 1943, and it opened to the public in 1959—six months after the architect's death.\"\"\"\n",

      "\"Vitruvius: The Ten Books on Architecture,\" translated by Morris Hicky Morgan, is a seminal work on architecture that emphasizes the importance of both practical skills and theoretical knowledge for architects. In the preface, Vitruvius addresses Emperor Caesar, expressing his desire to share his insights on architecture, particularly in light of the emperor's commitment to public building projects. He reflects on his past service and the influence of Caesar's father, which motivates him to contribute to the architectural legacy of Rome. The first chapter outlines the essential education of an architect, advocating for a well-rounded understanding of various disciplines. Vitruvius argues that true authority in architecture comes from a balance of practical experience and scholarly knowledge, enabling architects to effectively evaluate and create enduring structures.\n",
      "Processing chunk 2 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text emphasizes the dual aspects essential for an architect: the subject matter (the thing signified) and the scientific principles that provide significance (that which gives it significance). An architect must possess both natural talent and formal education, excelling in various fields such as drawing, geometry, history, music, medicine, law, and astronomy. This broad knowledge enables architects to create meaningful designs and explain their historical and cultural contexts. For instance, the use of Caryatides in architecture symbolizes the punishment of the people of Caryae, while the Persian Porch serves as a monument to the Lacedaemonians' victory over the Persians. Such historical references enrich architectural works and ensure their lasting impact.\n",
      "Processing chunk 3 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text emphasizes the importance of philosophy, music, medicine, law, and astronomy in the education of an architect. Philosophy cultivates qualities such as honesty and integrity, essential for proper architectural practice. A solid understanding of physics is necessary to address practical challenges, such as water flow. Music knowledge is crucial for tuning instruments used in construction and ensuring harmony in theaters. Architects must also be familiar with medicine to assess site health and legal principles to navigate building regulations and contracts effectively. Lastly, a grasp of astronomy aids in understanding orientation and sundial theory. The author argues that aspiring architects should not claim the title without a comprehensive education in these diverse fields.\n",
      "Processing chunk 4 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the relationship between various fields of study and the role of an architect in relation to them. It suggests that while a liberal education allows individuals to recognize connections among different disciplines, it is unrealistic to expect an architect to master all arts and sciences to the same degree as specialists. The author argues that even experts in single fields struggle to achieve the highest level of skill, making it improbable for an architect, who must engage with multiple disciplines, to excel in all. The distinction between the practical execution of work and the theoretical understanding of it is emphasized, noting that while theory can be shared among scholars, the practical application is best left to those trained specifically in each field.\n",
      "Processing chunk 5 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the intersection of various disciplines, including astronomy, music, and geometry, with architecture, emphasizing that while architects should possess a foundational understanding of these fields, mastery in a single art is essential for practical execution. It highlights that exceptional individuals, like Aristarchus and Archimedes, who excel in multiple disciplines, can transcend the role of architects to become pure mathematicians. The author acknowledges the rarity of such talents and requests leniency for any grammatical shortcomings in his writing, as he approaches the subject from an architectural perspective rather than as a philosopher or rhetorician. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the second chapter, the fundamental principles of architecture are outlined, focusing on Order, Arrangement, Eurythmy, Symmetry, Propriety, and Economy. Order pertains to the proportionality and measurement of individual components within a structure, while Arrangement involves the proper placement and aesthetic appeal of these components, expressed through groundplans, elevations, and perspectives. The text emphasizes the importance of reflection and invention in the architectural process, highlighting the need for thoughtful planning and innovative problem-solving.\n",
      "Processing chunk 6 / 14 ...\n",
      "Eurythmy embodies beauty and fitness through the harmonious proportions of its components, ensuring that each part corresponds symmetrically to the whole. Symmetry involves a balanced relationship among the elements of a work, akin to the harmonious proportions found in the human body and perfect architectural designs, such as temples, where specific measurements dictate aesthetic coherence. Propriety in design arises from established principles, usage, and natural considerations. For instance, the architectural style of temples reflects the nature of the deities they honor, with Doric styles for strong gods and Corinthian for delicate ones. Additionally, propriety is maintained through appropriate design choices, such as matching elegant entrances with lavish interiors, and ensuring that sacred sites are located in healthy environments with suitable resources. Natural factors also dictate the optimal orientation of buildings to maximize light and comfort, enhancing the overall dignity and effectiveness of the structures.\n",
      "Processing chunk 7 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the principles of economy in architecture, emphasizing the efficient management of materials and costs in construction. Architects should avoid demanding materials that are scarce or expensive, opting instead for locally available alternatives. It also highlights the need for different types of housing based on the socioeconomic status of occupants, ensuring that each class has appropriately designed dwellings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text outlines three departments of architecture: building, timepiece making, and machinery construction. Building is further divided into public structures (defensive, religious, and utilitarian) and private constructions. Key considerations for all buildings include durability, convenience, and aesthetic appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it addresses the selection of a healthy site for fortified towns, recommending locations that are high, temperate, and free from marshes to avoid health risks. The text warns against southern and western exposures due to harmful temperature variations, advocating for northern light in storage areas to maintain quality.\n",
      "Processing chunk 8 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the effects of heat as a universal solvent that weakens and alters the natural strength of materials and living beings. It illustrates this with the example of iron, which can be reshaped when heated and hardens again when cooled. The author notes that heat can weaken individuals, particularly in summer, while cooler temperatures in winter promote health. The text warns against establishing towns in areas prone to hot winds, as excessive heat can disrupt the balance of the four elements (heat, moisture, earth, and air) that compose all bodies. Each type of animal has a unique elemental composition suited to its environment, and imbalances can lead to deterioration. Therefore, the author emphasizes the importance of selecting a temperate climate for city planning to ensure health and well-being.\n",
      "Processing chunk 9 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text emphasizes the importance of selecting healthy sites for building towns or military posts, drawing on ancient practices where cattle were sacrificed to assess the quality of food and water by examining their livers. If abnormalities were found, the site was deemed unsuitable. The author cites an example from Crete, where cattle on different riverbanks exhibited varying health due to the local vegetation. It is suggested that marshy areas can be healthy if they have proper drainage and are near the sea, as seen in towns like Altino and Ravenna. Conversely, stagnant marshes, such as the Pomptine marshes, lead to disease, exemplified by the town of Old Salpia, which was relocated to a healthier site. After ensuring the healthiness of a location, the next step is to construct robust city walls, ensuring they are built on solid foundations and are thicker at the base for stability.\n",
      "Processing chunk 10 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text outlines principles for constructing effective city walls and fortifications. Key strategies include projecting towers beyond the wall to expose attackers to flank fire, designing roads that approach gates at angles to protect defenders, and using circular layouts for towns to enhance visibility against enemies. Walls should be thick enough for soldiers to pass without obstruction and reinforced with charred olive wood ties for durability. Towers should be spaced closely and designed in round or polygonal shapes to withstand attacks. Additionally, earthen ramparts can be added for extra defense, particularly in elevated areas, supported by deep ditches and robust foundations. The choice of materials for wall construction can vary based on local availability, emphasizing practicality over uniformity.\n",
      "Processing chunk 11 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the importance of strategic urban planning to mitigate the effects of various winds on health and comfort. It emphasizes the need to design streets and house lots in a fortified town to exclude cold, hot, and moist winds, using Mytilene as a cautionary example of poor foresight. The nature of wind is explained as a result of heat and moisture interaction, illustrated through the operation of eolipiles. The text argues that by blocking winds, a healthier environment can be created, aiding in the recovery of patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Additionally, it addresses the classification of winds, noting that while traditionally four winds were recognized, more recent studies identify eight, with Andronicus of Cyrrhus providing a notable representation of these winds in a marble tower in Athens. The text concludes with a method for determining wind directions.\n",
      "Processing chunk 12 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text outlines a method for constructing a precise layout for a city using a marble amussium and a bronze gnomon to track shadows, which helps determine cardinal directions. By marking the shadow's endpoints at specific times, one can create a circle and divide it into sections representing the eight primary wind directions. This arrangement aims to protect buildings from strong winds by orienting streets and houses away from the wind's direct path, allowing the wind to disperse against building angles. The author acknowledges the existence of many wind names but emphasizes the significance of the eight main directions, referencing Eratosthenes' calculations regarding the earth's circumference and the variability of winds within these sectors.\n",
      "Processing chunk 13 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the phenomenon of early morning breezes, which arise as the sun rises and interacts with humid air. It connects these breezes to the Greek names for winds and the concept of tomorrow. The author addresses potential criticisms of Eratosthenes' measurements of the earth, suggesting that inaccuracies would only affect the extent of wind patterns, not the principles of wind direction. To aid understanding, the author provides a method for determining cardinal directions and dividing the wind's compass into eight sections using geometric principles. This method involves using a gnomon to track shadows and drawing intersecting lines to establish wind directions, ultimately guiding the placement of public buildings.\n",
      "Processing chunk 14 / 14 ...\n",
      "The text discusses the selection of building sites for temples, the forum, and public spaces in a city, emphasizing convenience and utility. For coastal cities, the forum should be near the harbor, while inland cities should place it centrally. Temples dedicated to major deities like Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva should be on elevated ground for visibility. Specific locations are suggested for other gods, such as Mercury in the forum and Venus at the harbor, with certain deities like Mars and Ceres positioned outside the city to mitigate social and moral issues. The author plans to elaborate on temple construction, materials, proportions, and symmetry in subsequent books.\n"
